# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

LOCAL DB/BE ------------------------------------------

## `npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000`

You dont have to use port 8000, you just need to use another port then 3000 which is used by react.

To change the data being served just edit data/db.json.

## Philip Info:

So, as I'm really more of a BE/nodeJS guy I chose to keep it simple with the task at hand.
That and also the fact that I'm pressed for time as I'm on paternity leave I felt that I would do
best in using some boilerplate project to actually finish the tasks "fast" enough.

So I user CRA to start and then a simple JSON-server to act as BE.

I chose to do these features:

-   Responsive design, works onmobile and tablets (2 pt)
-   Donâ€™t use our API, build yourown API by scraping thecurrent page and setting up alocal backend server.
    How/Ifyou persist is up to you. (4 pt)
-   Works in Chrome, Firefox,Edge (1 pt)
-   Works in IE11 (1 pt)

Look forward to hearing from you :)
Peace!
